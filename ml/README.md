# ML

## About

The goal of this project is to reinforce foundational ML concepts. This repository has two focus points:

1. Code - lives in `classifiers/`, `loss/`, `regresion/`, `train/` . This is where all the from-scratch algorithms are implemented.
2. Tutorials - lives in `tutorials/`. A collection of Jupyter notebooks that give a high level overview of ML techniques through a series of 'real-world' problems. Notebooks contain a mixture of text, plots, math (latex), and code.

## TODOs

- Regression
- [ ] Fix hyper-parameters after refactor
  - [ ] Perhaps build tool that automatically tunes these
- [ ] Finish multi parameter descend implementation
  - [ ] Add math to tutorial
