# Math

## linalg

Contains some common linear algebra operations implemented in numpy. 

### Convention

To keep consistent with the literature, variables that contain matrices are capitalized and vectors will  remain lower case. 
Ex:
```python
A = np.array([[ 1,2]
              ,[3,4]])

b = np.array([1,2,3,4])
```

There may also be some code that is less pythonic and reads more like math.
